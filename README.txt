THIS WAS HACKED TOGETHER AND IS NOT REALLY READY FOR PRODUCTION USE.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Monitors a UT2k4 server for players and game information and can be set up to alert users when
there is activity on the server as well as announcing game progress.

Configuration options are channel-specific (or global).

For channel config:
  config channel #<name> supybot.plugins.UnrealTournament.<config name> <value>
